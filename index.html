        <h2>Top 3 MLB Teams in 2024</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>1. <b>Houston Astros</b></h3>
        <p><b>Star Players:</b> Yordan Alvarez (DH/OF), Kyle Tucker (OF), Jose Altuve (2B), Josh Hader (CP)</p>
        <p><b>Outlook:</b> After a hearbreaking loss in the ALCS to the division rival Rangers, the Astros look to maintain their title as AL West champs in 2024. After losing some key bullpen pieces like Ryne Stanek and Hector Neris, GM Dana Brown signed star closer Josh Hader to keep their pitching staff rock solid.</p>

        <h3>2. <b>Atlanta Braves</b></h3>
        <p><b>Star Players:</b> Ronald Acuña Jr. (OF), Spencer Strider (SP), Ozzie Albies (2B), Austin Riley (3B)</p>
        <p><b>Outlook:</b>Despite a loss to the 90-win phillies in the NLDS, the Braves remain as the team to beat in the NL East. Ronald Acuña Jr. is coming off of one of the most dominant offensive seasons in MLB history, and the signings of star pitcher Chris Sale and impact rookie Jarred Kelenic have bolstered an already stacked roster. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>3. <b>Los Angeles Dodgers</b></h3>
        <p><b>Star Players:</b> Shohei Ohtani (DH), Freddie Freeman (1B), Mookie Betts (SS), Yoshinobu Yamamoto (SP)</p>
        <p><b>Outlook:</b>This year's dodgers team might be one of the best we've ever seen. Dodgers owner Mark Walter went all-out in improving the already impressive L.A. roster. Despite fierce competition from numerous teams around the league, the Dodgers were able to lock up superstar Shohei Ohtani, signing him to an unbelievable 700 million dollar contract. They also signed Japanese star pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who was regarded as the top pitcher in Japan's NPB. Expect the Dodgers to do big things in 2024. </p>
